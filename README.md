This project presents a book recommendation system implemented using collaborative filtering techniques, including both user-based and item-based nearest neighbor models. The system processes user-book rating datasets to compute similarities using Euclidean distance and cosine similarity, then predicts personalized recommendations. It handles cold-start issues using feature engineering and hybrid strategiesâ€”leveraging known user preferences and book similarities. Regression-based models are also used to refine predictions. The system includes functionality for rating prediction, top-N book suggestions, and visual analysis of rating distributions.
